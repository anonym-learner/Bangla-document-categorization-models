# Bangla-document-categorization-models

Here are the Deep learning Models that we've implemented for one of our thesis works.

That include CNN and different variants of RNN, e.g. the vanilla RNN, GRU (Gated Recurrent Units), classic LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM and recurrent convolutional network. Word embeddings and Tf-idf are used as the textual features in this experimentations. All of these models are implemented on Python Tensorflow backend.
